# Yoga Practice Among Veterans:  A Qualitative Study of Provider Perspectives

## Research Question:

The objective of our proposed research is to explore yoga instructors' perceptions of the benefits and barriers of yoga practice for veterans and how that has been impacted by the shift to delivery via telehealth. We will select a purposive sample of (N=10) yoga instructors teaching at Veterans Health Administration facilities to participate via semi-structured interviews. Interview questions will explore themes including motivations for yoga practice, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, effective yoga practice modalities for veterans, and others; and interview transcripts will be coded using Taguette.
